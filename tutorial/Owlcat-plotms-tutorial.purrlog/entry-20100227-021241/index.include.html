      <P>OWLCAT stands for Oleg's W--- Lightweight Calibration & Analysis Toolkit. The W can represent Wisely, Wantonly, Woefully, Weirdly, Wonderfully, Wickedly, Wobbly, Wankingly, Warp 9, or Whatever suits your mood. Owlcat is a bunch of scripts I wrote to help me reduce data. Of these, plot-ms.py, flag-ms.py and plot-parms.py are probably the most useful. </P>
      <P>Owlcat is (currently) in my Waterhole, so if you want to use it, you must first check it out: </P>
      <P>$ svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Waterhole/contrib/OMS/Owlcat </P>
      <P>This will create a directory called Owlcat. Now, make sure this directory is both in your PYTHONPATH and PATH. </P>
      <P>Before you go any further, please make sure you've got Pylab/Matplotlib installed (Ubuntu package python-matplotlib), and have a copy of the MeqTrees Cattery scripts (svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Frameworks/Cattery. No working MeqTrees required, just a copy of the Cattery python scripts.) Owlcat will not work without these.  </P>
